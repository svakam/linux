## What is Linux?
An operating system (OS), which is a collection of software that manages hardware resources and provides an environment to run applications. Allows applications to store information, send documents to printers, interact with users, and more. 

The term "Linux" most commonly refers to the Linux OS, but it also refers to the kernel. This is the core of the operating system and is the intermediary between hardware and software. Additional components are needed to supplement the kernel, like system libraries, etc. 

Linux is FOSS (Free/Open Source Software). 

## Why Linux?

Linux runs on multiple hardware platforms (phones, networking devices, PCs, supercomputers), while proprietary UNIX systems only run on specified hardware. 

It has a small footprint, which makes it compatible with older hardware. 

It works great for servers, since it's stable, reliable and secure; but it can also be used as a desktop. 

It's FOSS. 

## Linux Distro
A Linux distro, or distribution, is the Linux kernel + additional software like applications to create the full operating system. The software that comes installed by default can be removed and/or replaced. 

There are hundreds of distributions, each with a different focus, and many distributions are available to choose from and use depending on the need. 

Distributions can be commercial or non-commercial, for server use, for desktop use, for research, for multimedia, and others. Examples include Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and OpenSuSE). 

DistroWatch.com is a website to stay on top of new distributions available. 

The most common distros used in professional development are RHEL and Ubuntu. 
- RHEL is used most commonly at bank, airline, telecom, and healthcare organizations. To run RHEL, the license must be paid for. However, CentOS is an RHEL derivative that is free to use. 
- Ubuntu is most commonly used at startups, for SaaS (Software as a Service), social networks, and companies that rely on cloud-based platforms. 

Other non-business distros are Linux Mint, Debian, Mageia, Fedora, openSUSE, Arch Linux, and Slackware. 

Ultimately, Linux is Linux at the core, and choosing a distro over another doesn't have the potential to be the 'wrong' choice, per se. 

## Install Linux

Installation procedures vary between Windows and Mac. For all procedures, virtualization software is needed to install a virtual machine on top of an existing operating system. For Windows, [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is an example of virtualization software to install a full Linux distro as a virtual machine on top of Windows.
